% This BibTeX style has support for short (year only) citations.  This
% is done by having the citations actually look like
%         \citeauthoryear{author-info}{year}
% The LaTeX style has to have the following (or similar)
\def\citeauthoryear#1#2{#1 #2}
\let\@internalcite\cite
\def\cite{\def\citeauthoryear##1##2{##1, ##2}\@internalcite}
%% Call this macro before bibliography and after any
%% shortcites in the bibliography
\def\shortcite{\def\citeauthoryear##1##2{##2}\@internalcite}
\def\@biblabel#1{\def\citeauthoryear##1##2{##1, ##2}[#1]\hfill}

% Put a space after the commas and allow line breaks by taking citations
% out of hboxes.
\def\@citex[#1]#2{\if@filesw\immediate\write\@auxout{\string\citation{#2}}\fi
  \def\@citea{}\@cite{\@for\@citeb:=#2\do
    {\@citea\def\@citea{, }\@ifundefined
